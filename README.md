    <h2>Camellia - AbortController</h2>
    <h6><i>- The library for aborting promises and operations. -</i></h6>

<p align="center">
    Hi! You've stumbled across our repository for our implementation of WHATWG's <a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-abortcontroller">AbortController</a>, or an interface that exists to represent operations that can be aborted. While this package is more necessarily oriented for private-usage with the library, you're free to install and use it if you wish.
    <br><br>
    While <a href="https://github.com/mysticatea/abort-controller">other solutions</a> exist, this iteration primarily exists to be a native option, rather than using any modules for its purposes. Camellia aims to use it's own variants and sources, rather than relying almost completely on others.
